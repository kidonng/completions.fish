# 💅🐟 fishion

> fish + completion = fishion

Latest completions from [fish's source repository](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell), [syncs](sync.fish) every day. That's it.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Latest version of fish is recommended.

- [plug.fish](https://github.com/kidonng/plug.fish)

  ```fish
  plug install kidonng/fishion
  ```

- [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

  ```fish
  fisher install kidonng/fishion
  ```

## Notes

- **Completions for builtins and vendored functions are not included**. These are more likely to make use of latest features of fish which are only available through building from source.
- In rare cases, other completions do not work on latest version of fish either. Please open an issue if you encounter any.
